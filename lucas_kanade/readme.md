Here is solution for Lucas Kanade part of HW. 

In order to run demo of template matching - run ```python template_matching.py Dog``` where Dog is a path to the 
folder contains the data which is sequence of images for test and .txt file with tracking window ground
truth values.

```python lucas_kanade.py Dog``` - to run draft demo for tracking. I was not able to finish that task, so it is just a draft.
